# Change the name of sub titles

As I'm a fan of watching series on tv, it requires me to change names of subtitles to the same as each episodes of movies. \
I Always did it myself by copying and pasting names(silly right!) but as I'm becoming older and lazier, and my coding skills are improving it came to my mind that I could write a simple code to change the names.

So this is What I used: 

* just a little of glob
* a bit of os
* itterators and defs

and done!

and you can use it by a simple command:


```python
!python changeNameOfSub.py
```

or simply write in in command line(cmd) without !.
It asks you 2 input variables which are:
1. first enter the format of videos for example mkv, or if there are more than one format use a comma between them.
2. second, enter the path where the films and subtitles are. All of them should be in one folder.\
    p.s : remmember to change \\ in path to / or else there will be an error.

Another thing is that subtitles should be sorted when you see them in your os. what I mean by this is that all of sub titles should have same format or at least be in order i.e. sub2.srt should be after sub1.srt. Otherwise there will be a disaster.


```python

```
